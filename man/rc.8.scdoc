# DESCRIPTION

The _rc_ system consists of scripts that control system boot,
shutdown, and service management.  These scripts are invoked by
*init*(8) and are *not intended to be run manually*.


*rc* controls the system boot, and is invoked by *init*(8) as part of
init process.

*rc.single* handles what to do in single-user mode.

*rc.multi* handles what to do in multi-user mode.

*rc.modules* allows adding kernel module initialization actions.  It
is (nearly) the last thing invoked by *rc* during system boot.

*rc.local* allows adding local boot-time actions.  It is (nearly) the
last thing invoked by *rc.multi* during a normal boot.

*rc.shutdown* shuts down various services, and is invoked by
*shutdown*(8) as part of the process of shutting down the system.

*rc.d/* is a directory containing various *sh*(1p) scripts for
controlling services.  These scripts are called by *rc.multi* at
startup, *rc.shutdown* at shutdown, and as necessary during system
operation to stop, start, restart, reload or otherwise control the
service.
