	[ ] rc.fix is not documented:
	    This file contains some X11 font-related checks and is executed by
	    rc.multi.  It's ugly to include this file into the rc package.  May
	    be is better to move this file into one of the Xorg packages and
	    place it into the /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/ directory?

	[ ] printf() isn't builtin by POSIX (only in dash), and by
	    default is located in /usr/bin: that may breaks
	    "separate /usr" boot.  The replacement "echo -n" also is
	    not POSIX command (-n is extension).  Figure out what can
	    be done.

End of file.
