TODO rc

	[ ] Add rc(8) manual page.
	    May be use https://man.netbsd.org/NetBSD-6.1/rc.8 as
	    reference?

	[ ] printf() isn't builtin by POSIX (only in dash), and by
	    default is located in /usr/bin: that may breaks
	    "separate /usr" boot.  The replacement "echo -n" also is
	    not POSIX command (-n is extension).  Figure out what can
	    be done.

End of file.
